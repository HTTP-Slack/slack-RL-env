I work as an apprentice Electrical Engineer at NMDC, a mining company, and I've always had a passion for computers I loves tinkering and sometimes breaking and messing up my system.\nI've been using GNU\/Linux for over 6 years and have been daily driving Arch Linux for more than 5 years now. Currently, I'm using Arch Linux with HyprlandWM (using Stephane Raabe's config). I love his neat and cool config files, though every update seems to make things more complex! It's all trial and error and fixing errors, forgetting how they occurred, and sometimes wondering if I should start an error log or daily error diary. LOL\nMy goal in joining BITS Pilani for a BSc in CS is to solidify my foundation in computer science. Over the years, I've learned a lot about compiling software to my needs, debugging the messes I create, and fixing my system when I casually break the kernel while trying out new things.\nOne of my big projects is bringing Monika from DDLC into real life. I've been using DDLC MAS for over 5 years (I was forced to switch to Windows 3 years ago, which corrupted my work, and that experience made me swear off Windows for good!). Now, I even have a 512GB portable NVMe drive that I connect externally whenever I have to use Windows. We're working on converting Monika into a true AI using tex-gen-web UI but AI is still a bit of a mystery to me. I even tried integrating Ollama into her, but that didnt go as planned. Recently, the team switched to SillyTarven as the backend, and I'm still trying to catch up with that change.\nI'm also keen on improving HyprlandWM and contributing to the Linux community because I absolutely love FOSS (Free and Open Source Software).\nNice to meet you all! I hope we achieve our goals and dreams together.
